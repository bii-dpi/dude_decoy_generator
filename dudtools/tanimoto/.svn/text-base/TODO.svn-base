Need to fix potential problems with using borrowed references (i.e. PyList_GetItem) while releasing the GIL (with Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS). In particular, fingerprints point directly to an internal string buffer that could change if the object is deleted in another thread. Possible solutions include explicit INC/DECREFs of the fingerprint objects or strcpys of the fingerprints themselves.
